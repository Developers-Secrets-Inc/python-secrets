#### We Must Emulate:
```javascript
// Example: Button press state
<Button>
  <Default>
    Deploy
  </Default>
  <Hover>
    <Scale>1.02</Scale>
  </Hover>
  <Active>
    <Scale>0.98</Scale>
  </Active>
  <Loading>
    <Spinner /> Deploying...
  </Loading>

    <IconCheck /> Deployed
  </Success>
</Button>
```

### Every Detail Matters

#### Examples:
- **Loading skeletons** instead of spinners
- **Smooth page transitions**
- **Optimistic UI updates**
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users

```
Not just:
"Here's how to create an endpoint"

But:
"Here's how to build a production API with:
• Proper error handling
