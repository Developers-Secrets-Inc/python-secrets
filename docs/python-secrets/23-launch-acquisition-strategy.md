## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Launch Day Flops
**Mitigation**:
- Build in public during Week 8 (teasers)
- Have backup launch dates
- Spread launch across multiple platforms
- Don't rely on single channel

### Risk 2: Low Conversion
**Mitigation**:
- Offer early bird discount
- Gather feedback and improve
- Test different messaging
- Build community first

### Risk 3: Technical Issues
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive QA in Week 7
- Have monitoring/alerts set up
- Quick response plan for bugs
- Communication template for issues

### Risk 4: Negative Feedback
**Mitigation**:
- Ask for specific feedback (constructive)
- Respond to all criticism publicly
- Show improvement based on feedback
- Don't take it personally

### Risk 5: Burnout
**Mitigation**:
- Realistic timeline (8 weeks)
- Take rest days
- Outsource if needed (freelancers)
