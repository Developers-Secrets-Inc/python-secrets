# Pricing and Preview Strategy

## Content Preview Strategy

### Free Tier as Primary Preview
The **complete free courses** serve as the main preview mechanism:
- Users evaluate teaching quality risk-free
- Build trust through comprehensive free content
- Demonstrate value before asking for payment

### Paid Content Preview Tactics

1. **First 1-2 Lessons Free**
   - Users see advanced content quality
   - Hook them with "next level" material
   - Clear progression from free to paid

2. **Sample Challenges from Paid Tier**
   - Show 1-2 advanced problems
   - Create skill gap awareness
   - Demonstrate: "You've learned X, now master Y"

3. **Project Previews**
   - Showcase what users will build
   - Before/after examples
   - "Build this after completing this course"

4. **Syllabus Transparency**
   - Full course outline visible
   - Clear learning objectives
   - Prerequisites and outcomes
