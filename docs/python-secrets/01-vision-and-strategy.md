# Vision and Strategy

## Target Audience

### Free Content Tier
- **Goal**: Help learners become exceptional Python developers
- **Target**: Complete beginners to intermediate developers
- **Coverage**: All fundamental Python concepts required for professional development

### Paid Content Tier
- **Focus**: Software engineering and Python backend development
- **Target**: Developers ready to specialize in backend engineering
- **Topics**: Advanced backend patterns, system design, production-ready code

## Monetization Strategy

### Current Model
- **One-time payment** for complete course package
- Clear separation between free and paid content:
  - Free: Python fundamentals (complete path to become a Python developer)
  - Paid: Software engineering specialization (backend focus)

### Future Considerations
- Subscription model under consideration (not decided yet)
- Flexibility to adapt pricing model based on user feedback

## Value Proposition

- **Free users**: Get complete Python education without paywall
- **Paid users**: Specialized backend engineering knowledge for career advancement
- **Differentiation**: Focus on practical, production-ready skills rather than just syntax
